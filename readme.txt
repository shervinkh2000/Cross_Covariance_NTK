-Please run the script 'reproduce.py' to train the relevant models and generate plots similar to Figure 1a and 1b in the paper. 

-The file 'timeseries_data.txt' provides the time series data for a randomly selected individual from the HCP-YA dataset. Please copy the file '/timeseries_data.txt' to the current working directory before running 'reproduce.py'.

-The scripts in the "Numerical Verification" folder generate plots to verify numerical claims that are a small part of the proof of Lemma 5 and Appendix G in the paper.
